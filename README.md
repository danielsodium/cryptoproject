# Banking software

## Compiling 
The code can be compiled using `./compile.sh` on a unix system.
This will output `software.exe`.

## Running
The server can be run using `./software.exe BANK`.
The client can be run using `./software.exe ATM`.

## Network
Currently, only local network (`127.0.0.1`) has been tested
as I only have one computer.
